# Serverless Envato Sale Verifier

## Serverless Technology
Serverless is the new buzz word and we don't want to pay for the server resources while service is in idle. AWS Lambda feature lets you deploy your node.js code to the AWS and it will only execute on specific http events. By this technology, the resources are only used while it is required. Voila! isn't it?

## Envato
Envato is a marketplace, where you can display your product for sale. For each sale, envato provides you a sales code, which is required to verified before the product is installed. So for each product verfication you need a API that verifies the product purchase and you also need to track the sales count for single license.

## About this repo
This repo for serverless envato sale verifier, uses the serverless technology and verifies the sales of the Envato product. So you don't have to pay for a full server resources every month and pay per hit resource consumption wise, and also FYI AWS gives 1 Million hits/month to Lambda for free :), isn't is cool.

If you are benifitted by the repo, please hit the star.

# Thank you
